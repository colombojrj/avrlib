/**
 * Definitions:
 * - BOTTOM: The counter reaches the BOTTOM when it becomes 0x00
 * - MAX: The counter reaches its MAXimum when it becomes 0xFF (decimal 255)
 * - TOP: The counter reaches the TOP when it becomes equal to the highest value in the
 *        count sequence. The TOP value can be assigned to be the fixed value 0xFF
 *        (MAX) or the value stored in the OCR0A Register. The assignment is depen-
 *        dent on the mode of operation.
 *
 *
 * Organizational idea of this library:
 *
 * - The file defines.h keeps the definitions of the actual
 *   microcontroller timers (such as what pin and port the
 *   PWM is connected to)
 *
 * - This library uses those definitions to map the PWM
 *   pins. If a new microcontroller needs to be added, then
 *   it remains to add the port definition on defines.h
 *
 * - It is assumed that a timer has a single configuration
 *   during production. With this, defines were inserted
 *   to allow the compiler to select what configuration is
 *   needed and then, generate code only for that
 *   application. The main concern here is to keep the code
 *   size smallest as possible. If "dynamic" functions were
 *   used the compiler would have to build all unused code,
 *   occupying memory of the microcontroller.
 *
 * - Main philosophy: use the right microcontroller for the
 *   application. If it needs more peripherals, then it is
 *   not the right microcontroller for the application.
