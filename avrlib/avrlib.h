 *  This the main avrlib file. By including this file, all the abstraction
 *  functions, data structures (and more) from this library will be available
 *  on your code.
 *
 *  AVRLIB is written in C/C++ and is divided in three layers:
 *  - Device: microcontroller registers have funny names and change from device
 *            to device. This layer defines standard names and data structures
 *            for these registers
 *  - HAL: initializes and work with hardware. This layer accesses the data
 *         structures defined on device (raw registers are accessed directly)
