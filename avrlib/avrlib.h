 *  This the main avrlib file. Including this file, you will have access
 *  to all the abstraction functions from this library.
 *
 *  To use avrlib you need to configure the file config.h (do not worry,
 *  an examples is shipped with this library :-)
 *
 *  AVRLIB is written in C++ and is divided in two layers:
 *  - HAL (talk to the micro-controller registers)
 *  - top (use the HAL)
